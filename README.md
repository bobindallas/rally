# PHP Software Engineer Code Sample
Prior to scheduling a formal interview with the Development team, we require our potential candidates to complete a simple coding challenge.


### Instructions ###
Attached is sample application built in PHP 7.3, and is similar to what you might find in the APG codebase.  This example is based on the Fat-Free Framework (https://fatfreeframework.com/3.6/home) for PHP.

1. Initialize a Git repository for the project, making an initial commit of the code, unchanged.  Install composer dependencies using: `php composer.phar install`

2. Read through the “src/Shop/Site” directory and make comments on what you believe each section of the code is doing.  Please be as detailed as possible, a vague description of the methods use is not what we’re looking for.
    * Keep in mind, this project is missing files and dependencies that would actually allow this part of the application to work. There is no need to try to run this.

3. Take a look at the “src/Shop/Models” directory and create unit tests for each class method using PHPUnit/Mockery. Please write your tests in the tests/Models classes.  You may run your tests using: `./vendor/bin/phpunit`

4. Look over the StringService class located in "src/Shop/Services" and follow the instructions in the comments.

If at any point you believe you can improve the code, see anything that might cause an issue or break a test, please fix the code and comment why. 


### How to submit your code sample ###
Commit any changes made in the steps above.  Push your code to a public or private GitHub repository and provide a way to access it.  You may add the GitHub user “ninemind” as a collaborator on a private repo.

Please reply to this email letting us know you’ve completed it, along with the link to your repository.

We will try your sample using PHP 7.3.


### Next steps ###
We will review your code.  If we like what we see, we will work with you to schedule a phone interview with the team.
